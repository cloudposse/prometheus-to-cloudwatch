| exclude_dimensions_for_metrics | EXCLUDE_DIMENSIONS_FOR_METRICS | Never publish the specified dimensions for metrics (semi-colon-separated key values of comma-separated dimensions of METRIC=dim1,dim2;, e.g. 'flink_jobmanager=job,host;zk_up=host,pod;')  |


__NOTE__: If AWS credentials are not provided in the command-line arguments (`aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key`)
or ENV variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`),
the chain of credential providers will search for credentials in the shared credential file and EC2 Instance Roles.
This is useful when deploying the module in AWS on Kubernetes with [`kube2iam`](https://github.com/jtblin/kube2iam),
which will provide IAM credentials to containers running inside a Kubernetes cluster, allowing the module to assume an IAM Role with permissions
to publish metrics to CloudWatch.




## Examples

### Build Go program
```sh
go get

CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -v -o "./dist/bin/prometheus-to-cloudwatch" *.go
```


### Run locally

```sh
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export CLOUDWATCH_NAMESPACE=kube-state-metrics
export CLOUDWATCH_REGION=us-east-1
export CLOUDWATCH_PUBLISH_TIMEOUT=5
export PROMETHEUS_SCRAPE_INTERVAL=30
export PROMETHEUS_SCRAPE_URL=http://xxxxxxxxxxxx:8080/metrics
export CERT_PATH=""
export KEY_PATH=""
export ACCEPT_INVALID_CERT=true
# Optionally, restrict the subset of metrics to be exported to CloudWatch
# export INCLUDE_METRICS='jvm_*'
# export EXCLUDE_METRICS='jvm_memory_*,jvm_buffer_*'
# export INCLUDE_DIMENSIONS_FOR_METRICS='jvm_memory_*=pod_id'
# export EXCLUDE_DIMENSIONS_FOR_METRICS='jvm_memory_*=pod;jvm_buffer=job,pod'

./dist/bin/prometheus-to-cloudwatch
```


### Build Docker image
__NOTE__: it will download all `Go` dependencies and then build the program inside the container (see [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile))


```sh
docker build --tag prometheus-to-cloudwatch  --no-cache=true .
```


### Run in a Docker container

```sh
docker run -i --rm \
        -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
        -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
        -e CLOUDWATCH_NAMESPACE=kube-state-metrics \
        -e CLOUDWATCH_REGION=us-east-1 \
        -e CLOUDWATCH_PUBLISH_TIMEOUT=5 \
        -e PROMETHEUS_SCRAPE_INTERVAL=30 \
        -e PROMETHEUS_SCRAPE_URL=http://xxxxxxxxxxxx:8080/metrics \
        -e CERT_PATH="" \
        -e KEY_PATH="" \
        -e ACCEPT_INVALID_CERT=true \
        -e INCLUDE_METRICS="" \
        -e EXCLUDE_METRICS="" \
        -e INCLUDE_DIMENSIONS_FOR_METRICS="" \
        -e EXCLUDE_DIMENSIONS_FOR_METRICS="" \
        prometheus-to-cloudwatch
```


### Run on Kubernetes

To run on `Kubernetes`, we will deploy two [`Helm`](https://helm.sh/) [charts](https://docs.helm.sh/developing_charts/)

1. [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable/kube-state-metrics) - to generates metrics about the state of various objects inside the cluster, such as deployments, nodes and pods

2. [prometheus-to-cloudwatch](chart) - to scrape metrics from `kube-state-metrics` and publish them to CloudWatch

Install `kube-state-metrics` chart

```sh
helm install stable/kube-state-metrics
```

Find the running services

```sh
kubectl get services
```

Copy the name of the `kube-state-metrics` service (e.g. `gauche-turtle-kube-state-metrics`) into the ENV var `PROMETHEUS_SCRAPE_URL` in [values.yaml](chart/values.yaml).

![kube-state-metrics-service](images/kube-state-metrics-service.png)

It should look like this:

```sh
PROMETHEUS_SCRAPE_URL: "http://gauche-turtle-kube-state-metrics:8080/metrics"
```

Deploy `prometheus-to-cloudwatch` chart

```sh
cd chart
helm install .
```

`prometheus-to-cloudwatch` will start scraping the `/metrics` endpoint of the `kube-state-metrics` service and send the Prometheus metrics to CloudWatch
