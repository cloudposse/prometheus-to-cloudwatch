Make sure to define the following settings in `values.yaml`:

env:
  - CLOUDWATCH_NAMESPACE
  - CLOUDWATCH_REGION
  - CLOUDWATCH_PUBLISH_TIMEOUT
  - PROMETHEUS_SCRAPE_INTERVAL
  - PROMETHEUS_SCRAPE_URL
  - CERT_PATH
  - KEY_PATH
  - ACCEPT_INVALID_CERT
  # Optionally:
  - INCLUDE_METRICS
  - EXCLUDE_METRICS

secrets:
  - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY


If you deploying the module in AWS on Kubernetes with `kube2iam` to assume an IAM Role with permissions
to publish metrics to CloudWatch, don't provide the AWS credentials in 'secrets'.
The chain of credential providers will search for credentials in EC2 Instance Roles.
